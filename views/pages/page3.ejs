                    <h2>What Are Fractals?</h2>
                    <p>Fractals are geometric shapes that repeat themselves infinitely when you zoom in. They defy
                        traditional Euclidean geometry by having fractional dimensions‚Äîhence the name ‚Äúfractal.‚Äù Here
                        are some iconic examples:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>The Koch Snowflake</span>: Start with an equilateral triangle. Replace the middle
                            third of each side with an outward-facing equilateral triangle. Repeat this process
                            infinitely. The result? A snowflake with infinite complexity.</li>
                        <li><span>The Sierpinski Triangle</span>: Begin with an equilateral triangle. Remove the central
                            triangle, leaving three smaller triangles. Repeat this process for each remaining triangle.
                            The pattern emerges‚Äîa self-replicating Sierpinski triangle.</li>
                        <li><span>The Mandelbrot Set</span>: Ahis one‚Äôs a bit different. It‚Äôs not a shape you draw; it‚Äôs
                            a set of complex numbers. Plot each complex number based on a specific mathematical rule.
                            The result is a breathtaking fractal with intricate islands and filaments.
                        </li>

                    <h2>Fractal Dimensions</h2>
                    <p>Fractals challenge our understanding of dimensionality. A line has one dimension, a plane has
                        two, and space has three. But what about fractals? Their dimension lies between integers. For
                        example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Koch snowflake has a dimension of approximately 1.26.</li>
                        <li>The Sierpinski triangle also has a dimension around 1.58.</li>
                        <li>The Mandelbrot set‚Äôs dimension is a mind-boggling 2 (yes, it‚Äôs a plane!).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Creating Fractals</h2>
                    <p>You don‚Äôt need fancy software to explore fractals. Here‚Äôs how you can create your own:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Recursive Algorithms</span>: Use recursion to generate fractals. Start with a basic
                            shape, apply a transformation, and repeat it on smaller parts. The magic lies in the
                            repetition.</li>
                        <li><span>Escape-Time Algorithms</span>: For fractals like the Mandelbrot set, iterate complex
                            numbers and check if they ‚Äúescape‚Äù to infinity. Color the points based on how quickly they
                            escape.</li>
                        <li><span>L-Systems</span>: These are string rewriting systems. Start with an axiom (a string)
                            and apply rules to replace characters. L-Systems create beautiful plant-like fractals.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Art and Inspiration</h2>
                    <p>Fractals have inspired artists, musicians, and writers. They evoke a sense of infinity, mystery,
                        and beauty. Whether you‚Äôre exploring the coastline of a Julia set or losing yourself in the
                        spirals of a fern leaf, fractals invite wonder.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Fractals remind us that simplicity and complexity coexist. They blur the line between mathematics
                        and aesthetics. So next time you see a snowflake or gaze at the Mandelbrot set, remember‚Äîyou‚Äôre
                        glimpsing infinity.

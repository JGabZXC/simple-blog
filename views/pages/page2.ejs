                    <h2>The Quantum World</h2>
                    <p>Before we delve into the specifics of quantum teleportation, letâ€™s take a quick detour into the
                        quantum world. At the subatomic level, particles donâ€™t behave like tiny billiard balls. Instead,
                        they exhibit wave-like properties and can exist in multiple states simultaneouslyâ€”a concept
                        known as superposition. Additionally, particles can become entangled, meaning their fates are
                        intertwined even when separated by vast distances.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Entanglement</span>: Imagine two particlesâ€”letâ€™s call them Aliceâ€™s particle (A) and
                            Bobâ€™s particle (B). These particles are entangled, meaning their properties are linked. If
                            you measure one particle, you instantly know the state of the other, regardless of the
                            distance between them.</li>
                        <li><span>Aliceâ€™s Measurement</span>: Alice has a third particle Â© that she wants to teleport to
                            Bob. She entangles C with A. Now, A and C are in a joint state.</li>
                        <li><span>Quantum Measurement</span>: Alice performs a joint measurement on particles A and C.
                            This measurement collapses their combined state into one of four possible outcomes.</li>
                        <li><span>Classical Communication</span>: Alice sends the result of her measurement (two
                            classical bits) to Bob via a classical communication channel. This information doesnâ€™t
                            reveal the exact state of C but provides instructions for Bob to manipulate his particle B.
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Bobâ€™s Action</span>: Based on Aliceâ€™s instructions, Bob applies specific quantum
                            operations to B. VoilÃ ! B now assumes the same state as C.</li>
                        <li><span>Result</span>: The quantum information of C has been teleported from Alice to Bob
                            without physically moving the particle itself.</li>
                    </ol>
